# Helm Chart Template

This Helm Chart provides a generic and reusable solution for deploying applications on Kubernetes. Helm is a package management tool for Kubernetes that allows you to define, install, and upgrade Kubernetes applications.

This particular Helm Chart is configurable and can be used to deploy various types of resources on Kubernetes, such as:

    Deployments: Define how pods will be managed, including the number of replicas, container images, and more.

    CronJobs: Schedule tasks similar to Unix cron jobs.
    
    Services: Expose pods so they can be accessed within or outside the cluster.
    
    Ingresses: Manage external access to services in the cluster, typically via HTTP/HTTPS.
    
    ConfigMaps: Store configuration data that can be consumed by pods.
    
    Secrets: Store sensitive information like passwords and tokens securely.
    
    Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA): Automatically adjust the number of replicas of a deployment or replicaset based on CPU/memory usage.
    
    Service Accounts: Specify service accounts that pods can use to authenticate with Kubernetes and other services.

The values.yaml file is used to define default values and specific configurations that can be adjusted as needed for different environments or applications.

Any application can use this generic Helm Chart by adjusting the specific configurations in the values.yaml file of the application's repository. Additionally, each resource (such as ConfigMaps, CronJobs, Secrets, etc.) can be enabled or disabled according to specific needs using the enabled option in `values.yaml` .

```

You can configure resources such as ConfigMaps, CronJobs, Secrets, Services, Ingresses, Volumes, and VolumeMounts individually or in multiples as needed.

The `enabled` option is a key feature in the `values.yaml` files of a Helm Chart, allowing control over whether a specific resource should be deployed or not. This option is particularly useful for flexibly configuring which resources are activated or deactivated in different environments or deployment scenarios. This function is available for these resources: ConfigMaps, CronJobs, Secrets, Services, Ingresses, HPA, and Deployment.

The sections `podSecurityContext` and `securityContext` are not mandatory. These configurations provide security contexts for your pods and containers, which can help enforce security policies. However, they can be left empty or omitted if not needed.

## Installing Helm

To install Helm on your machine, follow these steps:

1. Download Helm:

```bash
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helm/helm/main/scripts/get-helm-3 | bash
```

2. Verify the installation:

```bash
$ helm version
```

## Testing the Values Template

To test the template with your custom values.yaml, you can use the following command with the --debug flag to render the templates locally and see the output without deploying it:

### Code:

```bash
$ helm template --debug ./app -f values.yaml
```

This will help you validate the configurations and see what Kubernetes manifests will be generated from your `values.yaml` file.

## Deploying the Configured Values to Kubernetes

To deploy the configured values.yaml file to your Kubernetes cluster, use the helm install command as follows:

### Code:

```bash
$ helm install my-release ./app -f values.yaml
```

Replace `<release-name>` with a name for your Helm release. This command will apply the configurations specified in your values.yaml and create the corresponding Kubernetes resources in your cluster.

## Using in a CI/CD Pipeline

This Helm Chart can be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline to automate deployments. Here is an example of how you might include it in a pipeline script:

```yaml
stages:
  - deploy

deploy:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - helm upgrade --install my-release ./app -f values.yaml
  only:
    - main
```

In this example, the Helm Chart is upgraded or installed with the values.yaml configuration whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.
